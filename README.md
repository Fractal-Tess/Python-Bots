# Python-Bots

A couple of simple python bots utalizing the amazing power of pyautogui, opencv and others

Pianotile - a bot designed to get super high scores by taking pictures of the screen in a periodic intervals and moving the mouse to the position.

Valorant - a bot desinged for OPing. The main concept is to hold an extremely tight angle and hold the `watch` button as the bot tracks the pixels near the center of the screen.
If there is a sudden movement (aka pixel difference shift/delta), the bot automatically fires, killing some noobs in the process. (don't use if you don't want your account to get suspended)
